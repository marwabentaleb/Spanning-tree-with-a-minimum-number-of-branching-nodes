# Spanning-tree-with-a-minimum-number-of-branching-nodes
The goal is not only to get a tree but to have one that minimize the branching nodes. Thus, we define by a branch node, a vertex v with degree 3 or higher.

We propose two approach to solve the problem : linear programming and a heuristic. For the first approach, we adapt two possible models. One is with a polynomial number of constraints and the other with an exponential number.
